Program Description and Key Assumptions:
	
	My program allocates the party budget to the most liked items. In order to achieve this,
	I create a HashMap that contains both food and drink items and sort it in descending order based on
	the number of guests that indicated they liked these items. Then starting from the most popular item
	(highest quantity), I subtract one unit of that item from the budget as long as there is budget 
	remaining. 
	
	An improvement to this algorithm would be to assign weights to the most popular items, and only purchase
	weight% of the item as opposed to 100% of the item. Although in this implementation not every guest will
	receive the item they requested, it allows for a greater variety of food and drink items at the party.
	
	My initial implementation sorted solely based on total budget for an item = quantity x cost. However,
	this gives expensive items requested by few guests the advantage. For example, if only one guest requested
	Sangria ($15.99), the total budget spent on Sangria would be $15.99 x 1 = $15.99. If six guests then
	requested Chips ($2.50), the total budget spent on Chips would be $2.50 x 6 = $15. However, since $15.99 >
	$15.00, the budget would be allocated towards one Sangria and no Chips.
	
	As you can see, the implementation I ended up going with prioritizes quantity over overall budget. A key 
	assumption is that we have unique keys - I cannot have two types of Chips with different prices. We
	assume that we are buying one brand of food or drink item each. The way to
